Iternet culture interests me. Actually it confounds me, but more so it interests me, and what makes it interesting is precisely because it is so damn confounding. Never before have we seen such a mixture of reactions, culture, and memes into the stew othis is the internet. Just when you think you've found it out, it subverts your expectations, and you come to the realization that the culture of the internet isn't something you can label, or nail down. It's slippery and ever changing, continously in evolution at a speed and scale that boggles the mind.

But there's one less slippery piece, that can be analyzed for a moment (Hopefully before it disappears forever). The humble first post. If you travel across the dizzying paths of the blogverse you'll certainly come across a particularly unique specimen. Though it may be title "The First Posts", "Here We Go", "This Blog", "The Beginning", or even just "First". Usually they're short, hastilly thrown together to make way for bigger posts. Others skip the matter entirely, getting right onto normal posts. Probably good advice, as the great Monty Python would say, "GET ON WITH IT!"
